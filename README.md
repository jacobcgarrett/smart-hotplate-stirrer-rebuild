# Smart Hot Plate & Magnetic Stirrer Rebuild

A full rebuild of a broken analog laboratory hot plate/stirrer (Corning PC-420) into a high-performance, digitally controlled, network-connected device.

This project upgrades a legacy ceramic hotplate with:

- Fully digital control system  
- Phase-angle modulated heater & stirrer  
- Wireless communication (Bluetooth implemented, Wi-Fi capable)  
- OLED user interface  
- Fast, stable PID temperature control  
- Onboard data logging via SD card and USB  
- Robust safety features & AC shielding  

**Built around a dual-MCU architecture:**
- **Teensy 4.1** handles control loops, PID, PWM, encoders, switches, and SD logging  
- **ESP32-S3** manages wireless communication and the OLED UI

## üîß Hardware Features

- **TRIAC-based phase control** for heater and stirrer motors via 2√ó [Krida dimmer modules](https://www.tindie.com/products/bugrovs2012/pwm-8a-ac-light-dimmer-module-50hz-60hz-tasmota/)
- **Dual thermocouple sensing** (top surface + external probe via RCA jack) with cold-junction compensation using the MAX6675
- **Rotary encoder + OLED (SSD1306)** interface with stirring control and switchable temperature source (hot top or probe)
- **Bluetooth interface** for remote control (ESP32-S3; Wi-Fi logic also supported)
- **SD card logging** and **USB passthrough** (Teensy 4.1)
- Fully **isolated DC compartment**
- **Safety features:** overtemperature shutoff, power limiting, redundant fusing
- **Integrated EMI filter, fused AC inlet, and rocker switch** (Schaffner FN9290B)

## üí° Why Rebuild a Hot Plate Stirrer?

Commercial hot plates are often discarded due to simple analog circuit failures, despite having high-quality ceramic tops and induction motors still in perfect condition. This project offers a blueprint to **modernize those undervalued tools** using open microcontrollers and affordable sensors ‚Äî making precision lab equipment more accessible.

It also serves as an extensible platform for:
- Custom automation or reaction monitoring
- Decoupling detection
- Remote control of thermal processes

All with minimal extra labor or hardware cost.
